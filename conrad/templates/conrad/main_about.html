		<p>Genetic Algorithms (GA's) are a form of Machine Leanrning inspired by arguably the most creative force in the universe - evolution by natural selection.</p>

		<p>genetic-algorithms.com is a free and open-source web tool for creating and learning about Genetic Algorithms.</p>


<p>Instead of programming outcomes directly, or programming most of a solution and using machine learning to optimize a handful of parameters, GAs allow the learning process a high degree of control over your programme.</p>

<p>You just have to find a way of encoding your programme as a 'genome' - often using 1s and 0s (here we use As, Ts, Cs, and Gs) and create a population of 'agents' who attempt to perform some task using different encodings of your programme.</p>

<div style="width:800px;">

<p>Next you need to define a 'fitness function' to score the performance of your agents. The agents reproduce (and recombine their genomes with other agents) at a rate proportionate to their success at the task. Thus - in a slightly roundabout way - the population gets better and better at performing the task.</p>

<p>The idea behind this site is not only to provide resources on GAs, but also to <del>harvest training data</del> make interacting with GAs fun, by allowing users to collaboratively perform the role of a fitness function, deciding the quality of GA output and provide fitness ratings themselves.</p>

<p>At the moment the site only has one GA - <a href = '/conrad/'>Conrad</a> - which produces images based on a string of 'ATCG's. But you can find out more about Genetic Algorithms generally on our <a href = '/conrad/learn/'>Learn</a> page, and specifically our <a href = '/conrad/resources'>Resources</a> page.</p>
